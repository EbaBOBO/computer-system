## Part 1

**Remarks (optional):** <!-- Answer here -->

## Part 2

### Q1 (Atari game)

<!-- Answer here -->
What game did you choose?
Red sea cross.
Did you face any difficulties running/understanding the game? Was Stella easy to work with/well documented? What sort of additional documentation did you need, if any?
There is no difficulties running/understanding the game. Stella is easy to work with. I don't need additional documentation.

### Q2 (HW emulator assumptions)

<!-- Answer here -->
Have the basic infrastructure like keyboard, mouse and other controllers. If new hardware architectures come along, emulators should adapt according to its basic logic.

## Part 3

### Q3 (Motivations for preservation)

<!-- Answer here -->
Purpose and motivation: Encourage Software Reuse, Achieve legal compliance and accountability, Create heritage value, Enable continued access to data and services.

### Q4 (Comparing with other forms of preservation)

<!-- Answer here -->
Software is simultaneously a baseline infrastructure, and a mode of creative expression. 
Despite the obviously deep emotional resonance we are therefore capable of attaching to computer software, we have generally yet to commit to the scholarly standards, the public infrastructure and institutions, and the individual habits of mind necessary to document its creation and impact as completely and accurately as we do other kinds of cultural artifacts. 

Under this heritage conservation system, buildings are provided with one of three grades based on differing levels of significance. Since 1947, historic buildings fall into three categories:
Grade II buildings are of special interest, warranting every effort to preserve them.
Grade II* buildings are particularly important buildings of more than special interest.
Grade I buildings—the highest grade—are of exceptional interest.
Just 2.5 percent of buildings are listed as Grade I, while 6 percent are listed as Grade II*; the remainder—over 90 percent—are listed as Grade II. Local planning authorities use this system to help guide decision-making about proposed alterations in a way that balances the site’s significance with other issues, including use and economic viability.

Many ruins have been identified by UNESCO as World Heritage Sites and they are preserved as areas of outstanding value to humanity. Their function is to commemorate ancient civilizations, acts of human-made destruction, or crystallize natural disasters. The value of the ruin is acknowledged and its function is respected. The conservation process will therefore, ensure a close surveillance of its state and provide for the consolidation of the vestige as a vestige. There will be no attempt whatsoever to restore the ruins to their original (even if known) aspect, as the ruin has a function that has to be preserved.

### Q6 (Obligation to pay for legacy software)

<!-- Answer here -->
I don't think it is necessary to pay for legacy software, because more and more software will become obsolete with the progress of technology. If we had to pay for all the legacy software, it would be a lot of money.

### Q5 (Agency in preservation)

<!-- Answer here -->
Users, developers may all have the access to decide, it depends on the demand an different situation.

### Q7 (Legal protections for preservation)

<!-- Answer here -->
Yes, they should be protected. The government should have some policies to protect them. The policy should say what constitutes a violation of the protection Law, including penalties and so on.

### Q8 (Open-sourcing)

<!-- Answer here -->
In some ways it solves part of the problem. Because software like Git or the Linux operating system can be used and developed by anyone without constraints. One argument they make in favor of open-source software is that it is much easier to preserve and continuously maintain it than closed-source software, which depends on the original owner to take active steps to aid preservation, or to at least tolerate it (with the attendant legal risk for archivists).

### Q9 (Challenges with open source software)

<!-- Answer here -->
Some people may use open source software to develop illegal software and infringe the rights and interests of other developers.

### Q10 (Role of goverment/public bodies)

<!-- Answer here -->
My partner is Yiran Zhou.
I don't think the government should be the custodian of digital Content. Let the experts who know this part do it. Because many times the government does not have the expertise to manage this content, it may cause damage or be beyond repair.
The government should compel companies to provide financial support, actively support preservation efforts, release their applications to the public domain. This will boost the conservation industry.
